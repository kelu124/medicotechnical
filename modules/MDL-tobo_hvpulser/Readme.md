## Name
[`MDL-tobo_hvpulser`]()

## Title
Tobo HV-Pulser

## Description
* The HV-Pulser of the echOmods
* version: V0.1
* date: 24/04/2016
* technology: Module-compatible, Homemade PCB, ICs based on `HV7360` and `R05-100B`
* language: Altium
* author: Kelu124

## IOs

### Inputs

* [`ITF-A_gnd`](../../interfaces/ITF-A_gnd)
* [`ITF-B_5v`](../../interfaces/ITF-B_5v)
* [`ITF-I_pulse_on`](../../interfaces/ITF-I_pulse_on)
* [`ITF-J_pulse_off`](../../interfaces/ITF-J_pulse_off)
* [`ITF-S_3_3v`](../../interfaces/ITF-S_3_3v)

### Outputs

* [`ITF-R_reserved`](../../interfaces/ITF-R_reserved) : for the signal coming from the transducer
* [`ITF-mET_SMA`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_SMA) : for the signal coming out to the signal processing (if through SMA)
* [`ITF-mET_Transducer`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_Transducer) : for the signal coming out of the pulser (if through SMA)

## Key Components

* `HV7360`
* `R05-100B`

## Information

### What is it supposed to do ?

The aim of this echOmod is to get the HV Pulse done.

### How does it work: block diagram

![Block schema](source/blocks.png)

* [`ITF-I_pulse_on`](../../interfaces/ITF-I_pulse_on)->`HV7360`
* [`ITF-J_pulse_off`](../../interfaces/ITF-J_pulse_off)->`HV7360`
* [`ITF-B_5v`](../../interfaces/ITF-B_5v)->`R05-100B`->`HV7360`->[`ITF-mET_Transducer`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_Transducer)
* [`ITF-mET_Transducer`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_Transducer)->[`ITF-mET_SMA`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_SMA)
* [`ITF-mET_Transducer`](../../interfaces/ITF-mET_Transducer)->[`ITF-R_reserved`](../../interfaces/ITF-R_reserved)

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

* Only needs 5V and 3.3V
* Energy use : TODO
* ADC V_REF is flexible: using PulseOn and PulseOff
* Can use the potentiometer to control the tension
* Modularity through jumpers and SMA

### Cons

* Takes a lot of space because of the modularity. SMA, jumpers and pots could be removed.
* Little flexibility from the use of ICs.

### Constraint and limits

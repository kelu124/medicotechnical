* language: Altium
* author: Kelu124

# Information

## What is it supposed to do?

The aim of this echOmod is to get the signal coming back from a transducer, and to deliver the signal, analogically processed.

In order to test different solutions, this specific version of Goblin uses jumpers to select different inputs/outputs. 

First try at a SPI ADC. Using a 2 Msps one in order to catch only the enveloppe, to be tested with other uC, RPi or BBB. No more.

## How does it work: block diagram

![Block schema](/goblin/source/blocks.png)

* `ITF-G_gain_control`->`AD8331`->`ITF-C_amplified_raw_signal`->`ADL5511`->`ITF-E_signal_envelope`->`AD7274`->`ITF-mEG_SPI`
* `ITF-R_reserved`->`AD8331`
* `ITF-mET_SMA`->`AD8331`

# IOs

## Inputs

* `ITF-A_gnd`
* `ITF-B_5v`
* `ITF-S_3_3v`
* `ITF-G_gain_control`
* `ITF-C_amplified_raw_signal` : because it's used internally
* `ITF-E_signal_envelope` : because it's used internally
* `ITF-R_reserved` : for the signal coming from the pulser (if through track R)
* `ITF-mET_SMA` : for the signal coming from the pulser (if through SMA)

## Outputs

* `ITF-C_amplified_raw_signal`: Amplified Raw Signal, post TGC, before `ADL5511`
* `ITF-E_signal_envelope`: enveloppe of the signal, post TGC
* `ITF-mEG_SPI` : signal from the ADC

# Key Components

* `ADL5511`: Enveloppe detection 
* `AD8331`: TGC
* `AD7274`: 2Msps SPI ADC

# About the module

## Pros

* Only needs 5V and 3.3V
* Energy use : TODO
* ADC V_REF is flexible: better resolution in output of the ADC
* E_REF is being removed from the signal output, better than Murgen, where we lost 1.1V from the signal

## Cons

* Takes a lot of space because of the modularity. Jumpers and pots could be removed.
* Little flexibility from the use of ICs.

## Constraint and limits
